Hey milo,

first off now if you npm run dev this
you will now be able to click on add
account and it will take you to the form
you had before, get account will go to a new page.

This page is in the components folder
and is called samplePage.

When you want to make a new component
to link to. Just make a new vue file,
then go to the router folder, into
index.js. Add an import that follows the
syntax of the two examples and add to the
routes part of 'export default' in a way
that follows the syntax there.

The variable path will then be how you
change to that page, in the case of
sample it is at /sample.

So when you create a link to it
you will do href="#/sample", the #
is some thing vue uses to distinguish
between normal page changing.

For now I have gone to your header.vue,
gone to the part which corresponds to
the get account label and added a
href="#/sample"
